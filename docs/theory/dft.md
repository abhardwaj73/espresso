Density functional theory (DFT) approaches the many-body problem by focusing on
the electronic density which is a function of three spatial coordinates instead
of finding the wave functions. DFT tries to minimize the energy of a system
(ground state) in a self consistent way, and it is very successful in
calculating the electronic structure of solid state systems.

A functional is a function whose argument is itself a function. $f(x)$ is a
function of the variable $x$ while $\mathcal{F}[f]$ is a functional of the
function $f$.

$$
y = f(x)
$$

$f$ is a function, it takes a number $x$ as input and output $y$ is also a
number.

$$
y = \mathcal{F}[f(x)]
$$

$\mathcal{F}$ is a functional it takes function $f(x)$ as input and output $y$ is a
number.

## Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem 1

> The ground state density $$n(\textbf{r})$$ determines the external potential
energy $$v(\textbf{r})$$ to within a trivial additive constant.

So what Hohenberg-Kohn theorem says, may not sound very trivial. Schrödinger
equation says how we can get the wavefunction from a given potential. Once
solved the wavefunction (which could be difficult), we can determine the density
or any other properties. Now Hohenberg and Kohn theorem says the opposite is
also true. For a given density, the potential can be uniquely determined. For
non-degenerate ground states, two different Hamiltonian cannot have the same
ground-state electron density. It is possible to define the ground-state energy
as a function of electronic density.

## Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem 2

> Total energy of the system $E(n)$ is minimal when $n(\textbf{r})$ is the
actual ground-state density, among all possible electron densities.

The ground state energy can therefore be found by minimizing $E(n)$ instead of
solving for the many-electron wavefunction. However, note that HK theorems do
not tell us how the energy depends on the electron density. In reality, apart
from some special cases, the exact $E(n)$ is unknown and only approximate
functionals are used.

The essence of the HK theorem is that the non-degenerate ground-state wave
function is a unique functional of the ground-state density:

$$
\Psi_0(\textbf{r}_1, \textbf{r}_2, \dots, \textbf{r}_N) = \Psi[n_0(\textbf{r})]
$$

## Kohn-Sham hypothesis

> For any system of $N$ interacting electrons in a given external potential
$v_{ext} (\textbf{r})$, there is a virtual system of $N$ non-interacting
electrons with exactly the same density as the interacting one. The
non-interacting electrons subjected to a different external (single particle)
potential.

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2m} + v_s(\textbf{r}) \right] \psi_i(\textbf{r})
= \epsilon_i \psi_i(\textbf{r})
$$

$$
v_s(\textbf{r}) = v_{ext}(\textbf{r}) + e^2 \int d^3r'
\frac{n(\textbf{r})}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}'|} + v_{xc}(\textbf{r}; [n])
$$

$$
n(\textbf{r}) = \sum_i f_i |\psi_i (\textbf{r})|^2
$$

where $f_i$ is the occupation factor of electrons ($0 \le f_i \le 2$). The
KS equation looks like single particle Schrödinger equation, however $e^2 \int
d^3r' \frac{n(\textbf{r})}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}'|}$ (the Hartree energy due
to electrostatic interaction of electronic cloud) and $v_{xc} (\textbf{r}; [n])$
(*exchange-correlation* potential, reminiscence from Hartree-Fock theory, it
includes all the remaining/unknown energy corrections) terms depend on
$n(\textbf{r})$ i.e., on $\psi_i$ which in turn depends on $v_{ext}$. Therefore
the problem is non-linear. It is usually solved computationally by starting from
a trial potential and iterate to self-consistency. Also note that we have not
included the kinetic energy term for the nucleus. This is because the nuclear
mass is about three orders of magnitude heavier than the electronic mass
($M \gg m$), so essentially electronic dynamics is much faster than the nuclear
dynamics (see Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Now we are left with the task of
solving a non-interacting Hamiltonian.

$v_{ext}(\textbf{r})$ includes the potential energy due to nuclear field, and
external electric and magnetic fields if present.

## Exchange-correlation functional

### Local Density Approximation (LDA)

Energy functional is a function of the local charge density:

$$
E_{xc} = \int n(\textbf{r}) \epsilon_{xc}(n(\textbf{r})) d\textbf{r}
$$

$$
v_{xc}(\textbf{r}) = \epsilon_{xc}(n(\textbf{r})) + n(\textbf{r})\frac{d\epsilon_{xc}(n)}{dn}\bigg\rvert_{n=n(\textbf{r})}
$$

where $\epsilon_{xc}(n)$ is obtained for the homogeneous electron gas of density
$n$ (using Quantum Monte Carlo techniques) and fitted to some analytic form.

### Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)

These are a family of functionals that depends on the local density and the
local gradient of the density:

$$
E_{xc} = \int n(\textbf{r}) \epsilon_{GGA}(n(\textbf{r}), |\nabla n(\textbf{r})|) d\textbf{r}
$$

There are many flavor of this functional. There are also more advanced
functionals: Meta-GGA (e.g., SCAN), hybrids (e.g., B3LYP), nonlocal functionals
for van der Waals forces, Grimme's DFT+D (a semi-empirical correction to GGA).
They usually produces more accurate result, but computationally more expensive
and sometimes numerically unstable.

## Algorithmic implementation

We can write our Schrödinger in Dirac Bra-Ket notation:

$$
\hat{\mathcal{H}} \ket{\psi} = E\ket{\psi}
$$

we are going to solve non-interacting single particle Hamiltonian in terms of
known basis functions (plane waves) with unknown coefficients. We start with an
initial guess for the electron density $n(\textbf{r})$, and construct a pseudo
potential for the nuclear potential. In turn, we have the Hamiltonian. Solve for
$\psi_i(\textbf{r})$, subsequently $n(\textbf{r})$, and iterate until self
consistency is achieved.

The potential due to the ions is replaced by the pseudo potentials which removes
the oscillations near the atomic core (reducing number of required plane wave
basis vectors) and simulates the exact behavior elsewhere. The pseudo potential
is also different for different exchange correlation functional, and it is
specified in the pseudo potential file. If a system had more than one type of
atom, always choose the pseudo potentials with same exchange correlation (e.g.,
PBE).

It is important to note that DFT is calculations are not exact solution to the
real systems because exact functional ($v_{xc}$) we need to solve the Kohn-Sham
equation is not known. Therefore, we have to compare the results with
experimental observations. The Kohn-Sham wavefunction of orbitals is not an
approximation to the exact wavefunction. Rather it is precisely defined property
of any electronic system, which is uniquely determined by the density. The
in-exactness of DFT results come from the fact that we do not know the exact
correlation functional that truly describes real systems.

## Plane-wave expansion

The wavefunctions are expanded in terms of a basis set. In quantum espresso, the
the basis function is plane waves. There exists other DFT codes that use
localized basis function as well. Plane waves are simpler but generally requires
much large number of them compared to other localized basis sets.

$$
\psi_i(\textbf{r}) = \sum_{\alpha = 1} ^{N_b} c_{i\alpha} f_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
$$

Where $N_b$ is the size basis set. Then the eigenvalue equation becomes:

$$
\sum_{\beta} \mathcal{H}_{\alpha\beta} c_{i\beta} = \epsilon_i c_{i\alpha}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathcal{H}_{11} &  ... & \mathcal{H}_{1b} \\
... & ... & ... \\
\mathcal{H}_{b1} & ... & \mathcal{H}_{bb}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c_1 \\
... \\
c_b
\end{pmatrix}
= \epsilon_i
\begin{pmatrix}
c_1 \\
... \\
c_b
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This is a linear algebra problem, solving the above involves diagonalization of
($N_b \times N_b$) matrix which gives us corresponding eigenvalue and
eigenfunction.

Apart from plane waves, various localized basis set could be used, e.g., Linear
Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO), Gaussian-type Orbitals (GTO), Linearized
Muffin-Tin Orbitals (LMTO). Once could also consider mixed basis sets, such as
the Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). Localized sets are smaller in size,
they can be used for both finite and periodic systems, however they are
difficult to use/calculate.

In case of plane waves, we need larger basis set, and requires periodicity. Need
to construct supercell for finite systems. Use of [pseudopotential](
/setup/pseudo-potential) reduces the number of required plane waves.

## Variational Principle

Finding the ground state:

$$
E[\Phi] = \frac{\braket{\Phi | \hat{\mathcal{H}} | \Phi}}{\braket{\Phi|\Phi}}
$$

$$
E[\Phi] \ge E_0
$$

## Bloch theorem

$$
\psi_k(r) = e^{i \textbf{k} \cdot \textbf{r}} u_k(\textbf{r})
$$

$$
u_k(\textbf{r}) = u_k(\textbf{r} + \textbf{R})
$$

$$\textbf{R}$$ is lattice vector.

Fourier expansion:

$$
u_k(\textbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\Omega} \sum_G c_{\textbf{k,G}} e^{i \textbf{G} \cdot
\textbf{r}}
$$

$$\textbf{G}$$ is reciprocal lattice vector.

$$
\psi_k(\textbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\Omega} \sum_G c_{\textbf{k,G}}
e^{i (\textbf{k + G}) \cdot \textbf{r}}
$$

Contribution from higher Fourier components are small, we can limit the sum at
finite $|\textbf{k + G}|$

$$
\frac{\hbar^2 |\textbf{k + G}|}{2m} \le E_{\text{cutoff}}
$$

The charge density can be obtained from:

$$
n(\textbf{r}) = \sum_k \psi_k^*(\textbf{r}) \psi_k(\textbf{r})
$$

We need two sets of basis vectors: one to store the wavefunctions, and another
for the charge density.

:::info

We need about 4 times the cutoff for the charge density compared to the cutoff
for the wavefunction. In case of ultrasoft pseudo potentials, we require a lower
cutoff for energy, therefore `ecutrho` might require 8 or 12 times higher than
the `ecutwfc`.

## Flavors of DFT

Depending on the properties of material we are interested and accuracy we need
to achieve, there are several different flavors of DFT appropriate for a
specific scenario. For example, in case of calculation of ground state
properties such as total energy, structure, magnetization and vibrational
properties plain DFT (with GGA) or DFPT is good enough. While for calculation
spectroscopic (excited state) properties, there are more advanced and
computationally expensive methods. For single particle excitation
(*N+1* problem), such as photoemission, bandgap, tunneling, we may choose *GW*
method. While in case of two particle excitation (*N+2* problem), such as
optical responses and excitons, *GW+BSE* formalism is better suited. For van der
Waals systems, *SCAN+rVV10* functional is more appropriate.
